# Simple Ant Colony Model

Ant colonies (and their simulated counterparts) are one of the classic examples
of emergent complexity. By following simple rules, superficially "dumb" agents
are able to exhibit interesting cooperative behaviour. This is my attempt to
build an ant colony model, while learning some Racket at the same time.
